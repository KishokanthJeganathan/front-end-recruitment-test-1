Hi team,

Thank you for taking offering to take a look at my code for this front end developer role. I have to admit that I was quite surpirsed to see a test which did not test my skills with a JS framework but took me back to the basics of web dev. But it was rather fun to go back to working with vanilla JS as it made me appreciate the abstractions that the frameworks removed.

Prior to this project I had not worked with much with SCSS as when I was learning CSS, I wanted to learn it in its oroginal form. And then I moved to working with CSS modules and Styled components which is how I style most of my apps today. So please remember that the SCSS here is kept simple and not so advanced since I learnt it in an hour using the docs :)

I made the checkout code responsive for devices that are 425 and upwords as a bonus. I prefer to use rem over px as px is too restricitve.

If there is anything that you would have questions about, please dot hesitiate to write to me.

Thanks,
Kisho!
